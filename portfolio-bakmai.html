            <!-- <p>On the Internet, there are several hotel recommendation systems, such as Trivago, Trip Advisor, and Expedia. It is quite rare to locate the same recommendation system for rental properties, and most owners do not market their properties on the Internet but rather promote them to the residents. The issue arises when it is difficult to locate a nearby house rental near the university. Typically, the student will walk outside and inquire about the resident. It will take a long time for students to find a place to live for the entire semester. To address this issue, we want a platform that would assist students in locating suitable housing. The owner may also advertise their properties on the network in order to attract customer. The system will locate nearby rental houses that are available and compare them to other houses so that the customer can make an informed decision based on their needs.</p> -->

            <p>Bak Mai is a Malaysia-based worldwide online gasoline
                delivery marketplace. Fun fact: in some parts of Malaysia,
                they're called as Fuel Panda . They are, at their core, a gasoline
                delivery service that connects the petrol stations in question
                with the individuals who need it the most! Indeed, it's a basic
                concept that has shown to be quite effective. Its main purpose is
                to allow customers to request gasoline via a website or mobile
                application.</p>
            <p>Bak Mai's technique of ordering is a step-by-step
                process. The personnel at Bak Mai begin by gathering the
                customer's postal information. The data is then filtered
                depending on the information entered by consumers, such as the
                kind of gasoline and the amount of fuel. Then, depending on the
                GPS of the customer's position, Bak Mai's staff will purchase
                gasoline from a nearby gas station and transport it to the
                customer's location.</p>
